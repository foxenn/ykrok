                      <p>Our infant program guides your baby’s early experiences toward a lifelong love of learning.</p>
                      <p>Your Kids ‘R’ Our Kids  teachers spend lots of time cuddling and talking to your baby to instill trust. They provide a healthy early learning environment for movement, exploration and communication. Our infant care play area is filled with toys and books to help your baby develop at his or her own pace. Teachers sing songs and read stories to encourage language acquisition, and they pass balls and play games to develop the children’s motor skills.</p>
                      <p>Teachers work with the parents develop the child's daily schedule, including nap times, play times and feeding times. The First Steps classroom helps the children transition from infancy to toddlerhood as the budding explorers learn new vocabulary and self-help skills. In many Your Kids ‘R’ Our Kids centres, nurses and child care workers introduce sign language to encourage the children to express their thoughts and needs.</p>
                      <p>All programs are customized to your child’s progress, needs and age.</p>
                      <p>In our Infant programs our registered nurses and staff follows each child's individual schedule so that curriculum and schedules happen naturally and differently each day.  One nurse is assigned for every four infants. Supporting the nurses are the trained caregivers, nutritionist, and housekeeper who report to the Centre Head.  Activities are based on the child’s interests and abilities and are broken down into “needs something time” and “needs nothing time.” </p>
                      <p>Essential components of our Infant early learning program include: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Every infant has an individualized learning program according to his/her needs </li>
                        <li>Registered Nurses and caregivers manage the infants </li>
                        <li>During "needs something" time staff provide one on one quality attention for the child by meeting basic needs such as feeding, diapering, attachment, napping and communication </li>
                        <li>During "needs nothing" time staff will join the child with 4 other infants to explore and experience the environment </li>
                        <li>We do not establish a formulated schedule; instead our care providers follow the children’s’ schedules </li>
                        <li>We have a “No Shoe Policy" in our Infant rooms to keep the environment as clean as possible 
                          Children regularly experience the outdoors on car rides or on a blanket on the lawn
