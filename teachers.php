                        <p>Jeevitha, the center head at Your Kids ‘R’ Our Kids  located in Ecity, took Your Kids ‘R’ Our Kids ’s learning through play philosophy to heart when she created Family Game Night.

When children return to school on Monday, they write a journal entry about who they played with, what they played and what they enjoyed about the game. By playing these learning games, the children learn critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills and more. In May, the board games will be given to children and families of a local shelter for women and children.</p>

During the month of February, Pam and staff organized a gently used toy collection to donate to Toys R Us. They specifically asked parents to encourage their children to choose toys that they would like to donate, allowing the students to actively be involved and experience the feeling of helping others.</p>

The children spent the first few months of school setting the foundation for the project by learning about families, etiquette and manners. Christina incorporated lessons about different generations into all the learning domains. After some brainstorming, the children decided to make love bug pins with the residents to celebrate Valentine’s Day. The children worked with the residents to help them complete the craft, then shared a snack and sang songs. Christina is already planning the next event in May when the class will visit the facility to do a Mother's Day activity with the residents.</p>

                        <p>Esther, Centre Head at The Your Kids ‘R’ Our Kids  located in Padi, Chennail, teamed up to establish a classroom with a strong focus on investigation and research, supported by an independent, engaging and exciting environment. Following a donation of a cooler filled with tadpoles, the teachers worked with the students to create a frog habitat for their squirmy friends. Over the first few weeks, the population of tadpoles diminished, and Esther along with staff reached out to the Save the Frogs organization a WHO initiative for assistance. Soon the class was down to one frog, who was named Go. As Esther worked to keep Go alive and well, staff integrated the frog life cycle, environment and characteristics into her class lessons. When the children learned that frogs have become endangered due to a diminished habitat, they established along with WHO a local chapter of Save the Frogs.</p>
