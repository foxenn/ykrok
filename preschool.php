                        <p>In the Preschool years, emphasis shifts from emergent strategies of the early years to purposeful acquisition and understanding of content, skills and concepts.
</p>
<p>Children’s developing language competencies are more visibly used as tools for communication and for learning content and concepts. With increasing maturity of their physical competencies, preschool children are able to take on greater challenges in physical pursuits, and engage in more sophisticated pre-writing and writing experiences.
</p>
<p>Expectations for self and social development are prioritized resulting in even greater autonomy and independence, enhanced self-help skills, emotional self-regulation, self-concept and confidence. Our Preschool programme promotes children’s interests and their natural quest for knowledge; leading to experiences in problem solving, inquiry, investigation, discovery and active hands-on explorations.
</p>
<p>In the Preschool years, learning is naturally more structured and integrated across multiple disciplines to meet expectations for holistic goals, development of life skills, dispositions and attitudes, as well as academic achievements.
