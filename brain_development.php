                        <p>At Your Kids ‘R’ Our Kids, we use strategies from our Brain curriculum to support neural pathways for language, social-emotional, cognitive, and physical development during these critical years.</p>

                        <p>Our classrooms are filled with stimulating materials that allow teachers to facilitate children’s exploration through sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch as these sensory experiences send information directly to the brain and form the platform for healthy brain growth.</p>
                        <p>We understand that each child is unique, so our teachers cater to different interests and learning styles. From infancy, your child will be exposed to many forms of language (including sign-language), and immersed in an environment rich in language and literacy. </p>

                        <p>The Learning Library is a proven learning tool for the Brain.
</p>
<p>Besides creating our own books and materials, we have also partnered with educational product suppliers for kids from 3 month old infants to 6 years age group. 
</p>
<p>Children who enrol across our centres have a natural and unsatisfiable hunger to experience and to know about the world around them. A child’s access to knowing and learning is only through sensory organs. By hearing, smelling, touching, seeing child’s experiences and learns about the surroundings which leads to an overall development. Every exposure of each sensory organ to a planned stimulation strengthens the sensory bridge between the sensory organs and the brain. This results in the development of all the sensory organs, pathways and the brain. This development accelerates the child's capability of complex learning in future.
